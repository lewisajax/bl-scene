Source path can refer to a SceneObj's directoy or to a parent directory that contains multiple SceneObj folders.

Output path should be a parent folder as it will create a sub folder for the scene's terrain edit data

Use the exe and it will prompt you for the paths or run it via the cmd line and you can pass the paths are arguments.

Example:
```
Terrain.exe C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\SourceFolder C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\OutputFolder
```

Probably best not to do a lot of scenes at once, as they can get pretty bloated.
