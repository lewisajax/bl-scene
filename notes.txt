There's an ancillary chunk in each of the embedded PNGs (pHYs)

L16_UNORM and R32F might also be used for the terrain's texture maps

All the values have lost some precision. It's kind of noticeable but you'd have to be looking. terrain.bin only uses lz4 and zlib so there shouldnt be any data loss.
But there might be different tolerances when saving the values from the editor. Since they are fitting it into 16bit textures or byte values.
If so though, why would they have 2 different value sets between their terrain.bin and their terrain_ed.
Most likely case is that I'm doing something wrong when reading/converting the values. Or both.

Material weights have some slots that contain strings with values and such. 
Not sure where to start with that.
I'm probably doing material weights wrong here
TW could be reusing empty material slots to add data for prefabs and other shit. Since they all fit into the same amount of bytes as the normal mat weights
It could just be stuff that's in the .xscene or the prefab folder and it might be unecessary for us to work it in.
But we could very well be missing data if we don't parse it correctly.
Or all that extra data might be ommitted when saving to terrain.bin. If that's the case then we have nothing to worry.

Need to have a look at normals since I'm doing them wrong. However, it doesn't seem like the editor cares if the normals are broken in the terrain_ed.
So I've just left them in that state for the time being.
